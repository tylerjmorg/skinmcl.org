# Policy Version Ledger

Starting October 11, 2025, all future policies will include an ID and
SRI that update automatically whenever changes are made. Policies
referenced must always match the SRI and ID algorithm in
`/access_info.js` to this ledger; otherwise, the policy is not
legitimate or has been tampered with. This text markdown file serves as
the official ledger, listing all recognized legitimate policies along
with their corresponding IDs and SRIs.
