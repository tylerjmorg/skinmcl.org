            <p class="top-10">For no-show appointments or last-minute cancellations that do not conform to the policy below will result in that session being forfeited and will count towards the total sessions for that package. For treat-to-complete packages such as laser hair removal, the treat-to-complete offer will be null and void and the maximum number of sessions allowed for the purchased package will apply. Additional sessions will need to be purchased separately. Missed sessions will count toward the total allowed sessions for that package as listed below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laser Hair Removal: 6 sessions</li>
              <li>Microneedling: 3 sessions</li>
              <li>Tattoo Removal: 4 sessions</li>
              <li>Body Sculpting: 5 sessions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="top-20">Policy</h3>
            <p>All patients will be expected to <span class="bold">call our office at <button class="text-button top-10 bold" data-phone-button>(435) 716-8765</button> by 2:00 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled appointment</span> to notify us of any changes or cancellations. <span class="bold">To cancel a Monday appointment, please call our office by 2:00 p.m. on the preceding Friday.</span> If prior notification is not given, phone, voicemail or Instagram, you will be charged $45 for the missed appointment.</p>
